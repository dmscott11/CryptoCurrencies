# CryptoCurrencies
## Description
We were tasked with using unsupervised machine learning to classify existing data as it pertains to various cryptocurrencies. Unsupervised machine learning was utilized because there were no defined outcomes for the data that we were working. Methods used in this particular project include: 
- Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means
- Visualizing Cryptocurrency Results
